The soccer game is a team sport played between 2 teams of 11 
players each, who almost exclusively use their feet to propel 
a ball around a rectangular field. The objective of the game is to 
score more goals than the opposing team by moving the ball 
beyond the goal line into a rectangular framed goal defended by the 
opposing team. Traditionally, the game has been played over 
two 45 minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes.
